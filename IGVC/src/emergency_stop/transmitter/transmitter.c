 * @defgroup phobosfirmware_component_emergency_stop_transmitter Emergency Stop Transmitter
 * @ingroup phobosfirmware_component_emergency_stop
 *
 * @brief The emergency stop transmitter is designed to continuously send a signal to
 * the emergency stop receiver.
 *
 * The signal tells the receiver to either cut or provide power to the robot.
 * A switch determines the signal that is to be sent. If the switch is pushed
 * down, the signal is to stop the robot, otherwise the robot should keep
 * moving. The signal is sent to a RF transmitter, which transmits the signal
 * to the receiver.
 *
 * This code is designed to run on an Atmel ATmega8 microcontroller running at
 * 2 MHz. Please refer to the Emergency Stop requirements and design documents
 * when examining or modifying this code.
 *
 * Pin assignments:
 * - PB0: Red pushbutton switch - input, high = stop, low = go.
 * - PB1: Switch position status LED - output, high = stop, low = go.
 * - PB2: CTSO of radio unit - input, high = do not send data, low = send data.
 * - PD1: TxD - output
